PROBLEMS:

    * SWT:

If you see an error like "java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError", you will need to replace your swt shared library files and jar 
packages compiled for your system. TuxGuitar comes with SWT for linux-x86, linux-x86_64, mac and win32-x86. make sure download 
the correct file. if you need another version, download your SWT and replace in lib folder.             
If you don't have SWT installed in one of this locations: /lib, /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib or TuxGuitar/lib.  You will need to 
add its path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CLASSPATH environment vars.

Export LD_LIBRARY_PATH and CLASSPATH:
$export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/your_swt_library_folder/
$export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/your_swt_library_folder/swt.jar
$/home/user/TuxGuitar-*/TuxGuitar

    * UNSUPPORTED CLASS VERSION:

java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError. This means that your JVM is not compatible with the JVM used to create the binaries.  
If you see a message like this, you will need to rebuild TuxGuitar from sources.

    * FAILDED TO LOAD PLUGINS:

TuxGuitar 1.0 has better JVM compatibility than older releases. But some plugins (e.g: Java Sound Api plugin) still depends 
on Sun Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 5.0. if you have installed more than one JVM in your system, you can use one of these 
environment vars:  JAVA or JAVA_HOME to run TuxGuitar with a specified JVM.
