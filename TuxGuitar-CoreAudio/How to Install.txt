* This plugin is for using the native Quicktime synthesizer in TuxGuitar on mac OS X. It requires a version of TuxGuitar 0.9 or better (CVS).

The provided prebuilt binaries will probably only work in 10.4, it may however be possible to build it on 10.3 (I am not sure)

+------------------------------------+
| To install the provided binaries:  |
+------------------------------------+

Right-click on 'TuxGuitar.app', choose 'Show Package Contents'

copy file called 'tuxguitar-coreaudio-jni.jnilib' into 'TuxGuitar.app/Contents/MacOS/'
copy file called 'tuxguitar-coreaudio.jar' into 'TuxGuitar.app/Contents/MacOS/share/plugins/'

open TuxGuitar
open menu 'Tools > Settings' and select midi port 'CoreAudio' in the 'Sound' section

+----------------------------------+
| To build the plugin from source  |
+----------------------------------+

----------------------- Building TuxGuitar itself -----------------------

	if you are using a CVS checkout do this first:
	cd into TuxGuitar cvs source checkout
	type 'ant -Ddist.version=mac'
	this will produce a source archive that you will use to build TuxGuitar.
	
unzip source archive and cd into created folder
get itex and swt libs, place them in a 'lib' folder inside main TuxGuitar-mac-src source folder
edit build.properties, uncomment mac settings, comment all others
type 'ant'

------------------------ CoreAudio plugin ---------------------
cd into TuxGuitar-CoreAudio
Open build.properties and edit it so it has the right path to the TuxGuitar directory where you built from source.
type 'ant'

To install, follow above procedure.
